# QRCode_Generator
 Make Free QR Codes With Ruby


# Before Use
For MacOS (may work on other operating systems with some variation)

Make sure you have Ruby installed --
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

# Instructions
  1. From your terminal cd into the QRCode_Generator folder.
  2. Run command "bundle install" (for MacOS, idk the command for other OS)
  3. Open QRCode_Generator in your favorite code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
  4. Edit the file `code.rb` on line 22 to whatever you want your QR code to be.
  5. From your terminal, while in the QRCode_Generator folder, use the command "ruby code.rb"
  6. Save the .png with its own unique name because the next time you run it, it will overwrite the last one.

You may possibly need to mess with the sizing integers.
