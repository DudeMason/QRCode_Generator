# QRCode_Generator
 Make Free QR Codes With Ruby

# Before Use
For MacOS (may work on other operating systems with some variation)

Make sure you have Ruby installed --
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

# Instructions
  1. From your terminal cd into the QRCode_Generator folder.
  2. Run command "bundle install"
  3. Update the string on line 22 in `code.rb` to whatever you want your QR code to contain.
  4. From your terminal, while in the QRCode_Generator folder, use the command "ruby code.rb"
  5. Save the .png with its own unique name because the next time you run it, it will overwrite the last one.

You might need to mess with the sizing integers.
